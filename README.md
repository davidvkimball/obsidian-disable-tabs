# Disable Tabs in Obsidian
Disables the ability to open multiple tabs, enforcing a single-tab interface.

Closing or opening new tabs will always replace the current tab with the new one, even replacing pinned tabs.

Particularly useful when hiding the tab bar with the [Hider](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-hider) plugin.

You can also hide the tabs button on mobile in settings.
